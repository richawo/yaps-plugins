# Accurate Translation for Claude, ChatGPT Desktop, and Codex

This local-first plugin must be able to reach the Yaps engine installed on the
user's computer. In Claude, use Claude Code or the Claude desktop app on the
computer where Yaps is installed. If you are using ChatGPT web or a cloud
session, [download or open ChatGPT desktop](https://chatgpt.com/download/) and
retry in a local-capable Work or Codex session. You can also access this
feature directly in the Yaps application. The workflow checks actual Yaps
reachability instead of relying on a user-agent guess or assuming that Yaps is
uninstalled.

Accurate Translation turns a sentence, a Markdown or plain-text file, or an SRT subtitle file into another language through the local translation model supplied by Yaps desktop. Translation runs on your machine, so the source is not uploaded to a translation service and the translation inference consumes no metered cloud translation/API tokens.

The plugin and [Yaps 2.3.124 or newer](https://yaps.ai/download) can be installed in either order. Translation commands date back to earlier versions, but 2.3.124 is the first version with credential-free automatic account handoff. Older builds, including 2.0.1, do not expose the translation command this plugin uses. Yaps no longer has a free tier: translation requires either an active free trial or Yaps Pro. Trial eligibility and the current offer are confirmed inside Yaps.

After account access is active, the plugin uses the CLI already packaged inside Yaps; no separate CLI install or Agent Access permission is required. When translation is first requested, the plugin checks language coverage, explains the one-time model size, asks for approval, and then lets Yaps install the appropriate engine automatically: Standard (about 1.7 GB, 28 languages) or Extended (about 2.5 GB, 53 languages and the broadest reach).

Markdown structure, code blocks, and image embeds are preserved, and `.srt` files keep every timestamp and index. The plugin translates only the text or file you point it at, writes a new file beside the source, and never modifies the original. “No tokens” refers to avoiding metered cloud translation/API tokens; Yaps still requires an active free trial or Yaps Pro, and the AI client remains subject to its own product usage. To create subtitles from a video in the first place, use Yaps Subtitle Generator; for audio or video to text, use Yaps Transcription.
