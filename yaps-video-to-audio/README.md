# Yaps Video to Audio for Claude, ChatGPT Desktop, and Codex

This local-first plugin must be able to reach the Yaps engine installed on the
user's computer. In Claude, use Claude Code or the Claude desktop app on the
computer where Yaps is installed. If you are using ChatGPT web or a cloud
session, [download or open ChatGPT desktop](https://chatgpt.com/download/) and
retry in a local-capable Work or Codex session. You can also access this
feature directly in the Yaps application. The workflow checks actual Yaps
reachability instead of relying on a user-agent guess or assuming that Yaps is
uninstalled.

Convert a video file to MP3, WAV, or M4A through the installed Yaps desktop
application.

The plugin handles first-run Yaps sign-in and access checks, uses the CLI
already packaged inside Yaps, refuses silent overwrites, and verifies the
generated audio file. No separate CLI install or Agent Access permission is
required. FFmpeg is still required for media conversion.

## Example requests

Yaps no longer has a free tier. An active free trial or Yaps Pro subscription is
required. Download Yaps at <https://yaps.ai/download> or contact
