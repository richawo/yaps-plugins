# Yaps Text to Speech for Claude, ChatGPT Desktop, and Codex

This local-first plugin must be able to reach the Yaps engine installed on the
user's computer. In Claude, use Claude Code or the Claude desktop app on the
computer where Yaps is installed. If you are using ChatGPT web or a cloud
session, [download or open ChatGPT desktop](https://chatgpt.com/download/) and
retry in a local-capable Work or Codex session. You can also access this
feature directly in the Yaps application. The workflow checks actual Yaps
reachability instead of relying on a user-agent guess or assuming that Yaps is
uninstalled.

Yaps Text to Speech turns text or a text file into a WAV audio file using the voice engines supplied by Yaps desktop.

The plugin and [Yaps](https://yaps.ai/download) can be installed in either order. Before first use, open Yaps and sign in. Yaps no longer has a free tier: Text to Speech requires either an active free trial or Yaps Pro. Trial eligibility and the current offer are confirmed inside Yaps.

After account access is active, the plugin uses the CLI already packaged inside Yaps; no separate CLI install or Agent Access permission is required. The local voice engines are installed and managed from Yaps Features: Kokoro and Chatterbox read English, Supertonic reads 24 languages, and more than one can be installed at a time.

The plugin does not contain an independent speech service or upload text merely because it is installed. It invokes Yaps only for text the user explicitly asks to synthesize and reports the resulting local file.
