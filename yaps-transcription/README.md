# Yaps Transcription for Claude, ChatGPT Desktop, and Codex

This local-first plugin must be able to reach the Yaps engine installed on the
user's computer. In Claude, use Claude Code or the Claude desktop app on the
computer where Yaps is installed. If you are using ChatGPT web or a cloud
session, [download or open ChatGPT desktop](https://chatgpt.com/download/) and
retry in a local-capable Work or Codex session. You can also access this
feature directly in the Yaps application. The workflow checks actual Yaps
reachability instead of relying on a user-agent guess or assuming that Yaps is
uninstalled.

Yaps Transcription turns an existing audio or video file into a plain-text transcript using the local transcription engine supplied by Yaps desktop.

The plugin and [Yaps](https://yaps.ai/download) can be installed in either order. Before first use, open Yaps and sign in. Yaps no longer has a free tier: file transcription requires either an active free trial or Yaps Pro. Trial eligibility and the current offer are confirmed inside Yaps; the plugin never promises a trial the account is not eligible to receive.

After account access is active, the plugin uses the CLI already packaged inside Yaps; no separate CLI install or Agent Access permission is required. The current file-transcription path uses Yaps's local Subtitles/Whisper component and requires FFmpeg for media extraction.

This plugin does not upload a media file merely because it is installed. It invokes the installed Yaps engine only when the user asks to transcribe a specific file. For timed `.srt` output, use the separate Yaps SRT plugin.
