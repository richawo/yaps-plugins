# Yaps Background Remover for Claude, ChatGPT Desktop, and Codex

This local-first plugin must be able to reach the Yaps engine installed on the
user's computer. In Claude, use Claude Code or the Claude desktop app on the
computer where Yaps is installed. If you are using ChatGPT web or a cloud
session, [download or open ChatGPT desktop](https://chatgpt.com/download/) and
retry in a local-capable Work or Codex session. You can also access this
feature directly in the Yaps application. The workflow checks actual Yaps
reachability instead of relying on a user-agent guess or assuming that Yaps is
uninstalled.

Yaps Background Remover cuts the subject out of a JPG, PNG, WebP, or BMP image and exports a transparent PNG, or a version composited onto a solid colour, through the local vision model supplied by Yaps desktop.

The plugin and [Yaps 2.3.124 or newer](https://yaps.ai/download) can be installed in either order. Background Removal commands date back to 2.1.0, but 2.3.124 is the first version with credential-free automatic account handoff. Older builds, including 2.0.1, do not expose the background-removal command this plugin uses. Yaps no longer has a free tier: Background Removal requires either an active free trial or Yaps Pro. Trial eligibility and the current offer are confirmed inside Yaps.

After account access is active, the plugin uses the CLI already packaged inside Yaps; no separate CLI install or Agent Access permission is required. Enable Background Removal under Yaps Features when prompted.

The plugin processes only the file the user selects and does not upload it to a hosted background-removal service. It cuts out still images; for removing a video's background, use the Yaps app's Media tab instead.
